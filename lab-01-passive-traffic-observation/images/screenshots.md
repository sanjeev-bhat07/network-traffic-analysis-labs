# Screenshots Overview

This directory contains curated Wireshark screenshots captured during **Lab 01: Passive Network Traffic Observation**.

Each screenshot highlights a specific protocol interaction or phase (DNS, TCP, TLS, ICMP) and is intentionally selected to preserve full packet context, including protocol dissection and raw bytes where relevant.

Screenshots are meant to support the written analysis by visually demonstrating on-the-wire behavior, not to replace packet-level investigation using the provided PCAP file.
