# Screenshots Overview

This directory contains carefully curated Wireshark screenshots captured during **Lab 01: Passive Network Traffic Observation**.

Each screenshot highlights a specific protocol interaction or communication phase (DNS, TCP, TLS, ICMP, HTTP). The captures are intentionally selected to preserve full packet context, including protocol dissection details and raw byte-level views where relevant.

These screenshots are intended to **complement the written analysis** by visually demonstrating real on-the-wire behavior. They are not a substitute for packet-level investigation, which can be independently performed using the provided PCAP capture file.
